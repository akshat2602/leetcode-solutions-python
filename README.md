# Leetcode Solutions

## This is a personal tracker for tracking the leetcode problems that I'm attempting in my quest to prepare for internships as an upcoming grad for Fall 2023.

The repository is divider into folders and a readme. Each folder has a .py file that contains the solution and sometimes a markdown file with some tags and some notes.
